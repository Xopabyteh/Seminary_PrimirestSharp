# Primirest#
The project acts as a wrapper application around the [Primirest](https://www.mujprimirest.cz/) system + with additional features.
The main bonus is the ability of users of this application to take photos of their ordered foods
so that everyone else ordering it can see it.

The project is split into two parts - a custom backend wrapper api and a frontend Maui app.

This is my Seminary work for mensa gymnÃ¡zium `Sexta 2023 - Septima 2025`.
The project is built with clean architecture and some DDD concepts in mind.
But i am the only one working on the project and i am my own domain expert,
so i'm just using portions of DDD.
